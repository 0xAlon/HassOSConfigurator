No configuration required.  If problems are encountered please get all "Karen" in the foums and make sure to display attitude, because developers love that.  Alternatively, you can provide a log and tell us the problem, what you did, the model of your device, and what happened differently than what you expected.

Just hit the start button and observe the logs.  You may uninstall the Add-On when complete.
