## Run On Startup.d
This Home Assistant Addon allows you to perform startup scripts for each container, within the context of that container.  Tasks such as mounting folders, pinging REST APIs, starting servers, and other such tasks may be automated and performed by scripts. 

**Warning**- Proceed at your own risk. Your scripts will run as root and have the capability of destroying your machine.

# Operation
