## HassOS SSH port 22222 Configurator
Places an authorized_keys file in the location required by HassOS at boot time to enable the SSH port 22222.  Run it once and then remove it.  You won't need to run it again. 

You can connect an SDCard and up to two hard disks or USB drives, which are detected as sda or sdb, and they will all have HassOS SSH port 22222 enabled. 

# Operation
Hit the start button and observe the logs.  You may uninstall the Add-On when complete.
